# EDP: Expimental Data Processing course materials

This repo provides my team's solutions to different data processing tasks implementing multiple algorithms. It was part of the EDP course offered by Skoltech in 2020-2021 academic year given by prof.Tatiana Podladchikova.

Brief description of the course:
The course introduces students to practically useful approaches of data processing for control and forecasting. The focus will be on identifying the hidden and implicit features and regularities of dynamical processes using experimental data. The course exposes data processing methods from multiple vantage points: standard data processing methods and their hidden capacity to solve difficult problems; statistical methods based on state-space models; methods of extracting the regularities of a process on the basis of identifying key parameters. The course addresses the problems in navigation, solar physics, geomagnetism, space weather and biomedical research and will be useful for broad range of interdisciplinary applications.
